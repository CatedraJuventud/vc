<!--## Grid Illusions
A grid illusion is any kind of grid that deceives a person's vision. The two most common types of grid illusions are the Hermann grid illusion and the scintillating grid illusion.-->
## The Hermann Grid Illusion
The Hermann grid illusion (1870) in its best-known form consists of intersecting vertical
and horizontal white bars superimposed on a black background, thereby forming an
array of evenly spaced black squares. At the intersection of the bars, ghostly gray
smudges are perceived comprising the illusion.  The smudges are seen everywhere except at the center of gaze. In general the grey blobs disappear when looking directly at an intersection.
>"An explanation of this phenomenon by simultaneous contrast is easy. The apparent
brightness of each point on the white grid depends on the amount of black which exists in
a certain area around it. If one assumes the diameter of this area to be larger than the
width of the white stripes, then each point on the intersections receives in its surround less
black than any other point on the white stripes; its brightness will thus be less enhanced
by contrast and must therefore appear darker." -Kuffler 1953

### History
The Hermann grid illusion is an optical illusion reported by Ludimar Hermann in 1870.
Hermann’s Grid is an example of lateral inhibition — a mechanism of our visual system.
Light sensitive cells are arranged in rows on the retina and it is possible to stimulate just one
cell, called Cell X, to send a signal to the brain. If, however, Cell X’s neighbors are also
stimulated, Cell X’s signal won’t be as strong. Stimulating the neighbors of any particular cell
actually inhibits the strength of that cell’s response. This means that the strength of any
signal sent from the retina is dependent on the signals nearby. The places where the white
lines in Hermann’s Grid intersect have white surroundings in four different directions so they
appear darker than they actually are.

Kevin Berbaum, Chan Sup Chung(Berbaum K, Chung C S, 1981, p85 – 89) mentioned
the Hermann grid has been explained in terms of concentric receptive fields and also used to
determine the size of centers and surrounds in perceptive fields in humans. A new figure,
which is simply the outlines of the squares of the Hermann grid, shows that receptive fields
having a range of excitatory and inhibitory sizes may be responsible for the Hermann
illusion.

The classical explanation of the physiological mechanism behind the Hermann grid illusion is due to Baumgartner (1960). Baumgartner believed that the effect is due to inhibitory processes in the retinal ganglion cells, the neurons that transmit signals from the eye to the brain. To each cell there corresponds a small region of the retina called the receptive field, where photoreceptive rods and cones can trigger an electrical response in that cell. The receptive fields of adjacent ganglion cells may overlap. Kuffler (1953) used microelectrodes placed in the retinae of cats to measure the response of individual neurons subject to pinpoints of light stimulus, and showed that the receptive field can be broken down into a central disc and a surrounding annulus. Kuffler was also able to demonstrate that retinal ganglion cells come in two distinct kinds – either ON-centre or OFF-centre. It is the difference in stimulus between the centre and the surround of a given neuron that determines the strength of its response (i.e. how rapidly it fires). Baumgartner reasoned that the ON-centre ganglion cells whose receptive fields are centred on the grid crossings have 4 inhibiting bright areas in their surround, whereas those whose fields centre on ‘streets’ have only 2 inhibiting bright areas.

### Aplications
The range of application of Hermann grid and visual illusion is from Graphic Design to
Media Design and Advertisement Design. After World War Two there is a common view 
internationally that war is destroy for human. Then some designs become tools of
colonization. Some designs encourage unnecessary consumption by confuse consumers. But
designers should tell the truth to consumers, not should cheat consumers for consumption. It
is the responsibility for designers to educate consumers correct perceptions of consumption.

### Visual Phenomenon
The explanation suggested is based on the findings made by neurophysiologists demonstrating
that retinal ganglion cells have antagonistic center/surround organization (Kuffler 1953;
Werblin and Dowling 1969; Schiller 1996). Consequently, when the grid consists of
black squares and white bars, an ON-center retinal ganglion cell responds much more
vigorously to a small bright spot placed into its receptive field center than to a large
bright spot that activates both the center and the surround of the receptive field. The
argument advanced was that smaller responses are elicited in the ON-center retinal
ganglion cells whose receptive field centers fall into the intersections of the white
bars than in cells whose receptive fields fall along non-intersecting regions of the bars.This difference in activity is due to the fact that at the intersections more surround
inhibition is produced in ON-center retinal ganglion cells than at other sites. The
same considerations apply to OFF-center ganglion cells when contrast is reversed.

The dark spot at the intersection would merely be the consequence of less simultaneous contrast present in this location. An analogous explanation had already been
suggested by Brewster (1844) for light illusory spots. The assumption of a relative
depression of brightness or darkness at the intersection, due to less contrast, is
consistent with modern accounts of these phenomena.

Today, the most commonly accepted explanation of the Hermann grid illusion is
that suggested by Baumgartner (1960), which is based on the receptive-field organization of the human visual system. In Baumgartner's model (figure lb, left), brightness
signalling on-center cells stimulated by the intersection receive about twice as much
lateral inhibition as cells stimulated by the bars. As a result, the intersection appears
darker. Conversely, in a black grid on a white background, darkness-signalling offcenter cells stimulated by the intersection receive only about half as much lateral
activation as cells stimulated by the bars (figure lb, right). Thus, the intersection
appears lighter.

### The Research On Destroying Hermmand Grid
János Geier, Lászlo Bernáth, Mariann Hudák, Lászlo Séra(Geier J, Bernáth L,
Hudák M, Séra L, 2008, p 651 – 665) noted the generally accepted explanation of the
Hermann grid illusion is Baumgartner’s hypothesis that the illusory effect is generated by the
response of retinal ganglion cells with concentric ON – OFF or OFF – ON receptive fields.
To challenge this explanation, they have introduced some simple distortions to the grid lines
which make the illusion disappear totally, while all preconditions of Baumgartner’s
hypothesis remain unchanged. To analyse the behaviour of the new versions of the grid, they
carried out psychophysical experiments, in which they measured the distortion tolerance: the
level of distortion at which the illusion disappears at a given type of distortion for a given
subject. Statistical analysis has shown that the distortion tolerance is independent of grid-line
width within a wide range, and of the type of distortion, except when one side of each line
remains straight. They conclude that the main cause of the Hermann grid illusion is the
straightness of the edges of the grid lines, and we propose a theory which explains why the
illusory spots occur in the original Hermann grid and why they disappear in curved grids.

<!--### Scintillating Grid Illusion
The scintillating grid illusion is an optical illusion, discovered by E. and B. Lingelbach and M. Schrauf in 1994. It is often considered a variation of the Hermann grid illusion but possesses different properties.

It is constructed by superimposing white discs on the intersections of orthogonal gray bars on a black background. Dark dots seem to appear and disappear rapidly at random intersections, hence the label "scintillating". When a person keeps his or her eyes directly on a single intersection, the dark dot does not appear. The dark dots disappear if one is too close to or too far from the image.

It was discovered over  by J. R. Bergen in 1985 (as reported in Schrauf et al. (1997)). In short, the dots in the scintillating grid are really there - they are just sometimes experienced as being black when they are in fact white. Philosophers of perception often distinguish between three kinds of perceptual experience: (i) veridical (accurate) perception of the world; (ii) illusion—nonveridical (innaccurate) perception of the world; (iii) hallucination—failure to perceive the world (Macpherson 2013). In the case of the scintillating grid, the nonveridical perception of the white dots as black seem to make it an unequivocal example of an illusion. This means that some of the philosophical interest surrounding the Hermann grid – specifically, the question of whether objects which exist only as artefacts of the visual system should be considered hallucinatory – does not apply to the scintillating grid. However, it is worth noting that on some philosophical views there is no difference in kind between hallucination and illusion (e.g. Brewer 2008).

The classical explanation of the physiology behind the scintillating grid illusion is due to Baumgartner (1960).Baumgartner believed that the effect is due to inhibitory processes in the retinal ganglion cells, the neurons that transmit signals from the eye to the brain. To each cell there corresponds a small region of the retina called the receptive field, where photoreceptive rods and cones can trigger an electrical response in that cell. The receptive fields of adjacent ganglion cells may overlap.

Following Baumgartner's reasoning, the ON-centre ganglion cells whose receptive fields are centred on the grid crossings have 4 inhibiting light (grey) areas in their surround, whereas those whose fields centre on ‘streets’ have only 2 inhibiting light (grey) areas.The on-centre neurons centred at grid crossings will fire less and so these locations on the grid appear darker. The disappearance of the grey patches whenever we try to focus on them is explained by the fact that the ganglion cells in the centre of the retina (the fovea) which mediate high-acuity vision have very small receptive fields, so the range of their stimulus lies entirely inside the intersection point. Furthermore, the fact that the illusion occurs with inverted colours is neatly explained by the existence of the second kind of retinal ganglion cell, the OFF-centre neuron.
