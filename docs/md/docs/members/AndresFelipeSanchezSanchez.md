## Bio
I am 21 years old, I was born in BogotÃ¡. I am in fifth year of systems and computing engineering at National University of Colombia. I am interested in algorithms,machine learning and cibersecurity, so I enjoy learning statistics, math and programming. I often try to solve problems of competitive programming and read for improve my skills in this area.

## Interests
- Machine learning algorithms.
- Backend software development.
- Cibersecurity.
- Statistics.

## Contributions

I haven't had the opportunity to participate and contribute in a research open source project, but I would like enroll in a project in the future.

## Hobbies
- Play soccer

- Read books in my free time.

## Grid Illusions

The light or dark illusory spots perceived at the intersections of black or white bars
are among the best-known examples of a simultaneous contrast illusion. Th e light
spots were first noticed by one Reverend WSelwyn in the early 1840s and reported
by Sir David Brewster in 1844 at a meeting in York (Brewster 1844). When a window
with opaque dark bars was viewed against the bright sky, there was a whitish spot at
the crossings. The luminous spots were brightest when not seen directly. The converse
of this illusion, dark spots, was described (but not illustrated) by Ludimar Hermann in
1870, who saw them in a matrix of Chladni figures(1)
, in the translation of TyndalFs
Sound {Der Schall 1869). In 1878, Hering discussed the illusion in his Zur Lehre vom
Lichtsinne and in 1907 included two grids with opposite polarities in the GraefeSaemisch Handbook of Ophthalmology (figures 29 and 30) showing the dark and bright spots, respectively. The next to mention the illusory spots was Prandtl (1927),
followed by Ehrenstein (1941, 1954) and Dombrowsky (1942). Wade (1978, 1982)
and Hood and Petry (unpublished manuscript) have traced the history of this intriguing phenomenon that has become popular not only in visual science, but also in op art
(Vasarely 1965, 1974a, 1974b; Bode 1972; Wade 1982).
### The Hermann Grid Illusion
In this grid the
intersections of the white bars look less bright (actually pale grey) and those of the
black bars look less dark (actually dark grey) than the bars themselves, even though
the luminance of the bars is uniform* In the tradition of Mach (1865), Hermann
(1870) attributed the illusory spots to simultaneous contrast. Anticipating the idea of
a center - surround receptive field (Kuffler 1953) by eighty years, he wrote:
>"An explanation of this phenomenon by simultaneous contrast is easy. The apparent
brightness of each point on the white grid depends on the amount of black which exists in
a certain area around it. If one assumes the diameter of this area to be larger than the
width of the white stripes, then each point on the intersections receives in its surround less
black than any other point on the white stripes; its brightness will thus be less enhanced
by contrast and must therefore appear darker."

### Scintillating Grid Illusion
The scintillating grid illusion is an optical illusion, discovered by E. and B. Lingelbach and M. Schrauf in 1994. It is often considered a variation of the Hermann grid illusion but possesses different properties.

It is constructed by superimposing white discs on the intersections of orthogonal gray bars on a black background. Dark dots seem to appear and disappear rapidly at random intersections, hence the label "scintillating". When a person keeps his or her eyes directly on a single intersection, the dark dot does not appear. The dark dots disappear if one is too close to or too far from the image.
