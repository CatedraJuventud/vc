## Bio

I am 20 years old girl. I was born in Ibague, Tolima. I am a person interested in global warming and how we can stop it. I love going out with my friends and meeting new people.

About the academy, I am a fifth-year Sofware Engineering student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia with a passion for machine learning. I am always interested in how Sofware Engineering can improve the quality of life of people. For that , when I worked in project I always try to do my best.

## Optical illusion

 ### Black-White Gradient

This is a physiological illusion. This optical illusion is created by a linear black-white gradient in the backgroud. The brick at the front is a white-colored. The illusion makes the brain thinks that the brick is a gradient-colored but this is not true. Your brain overestimates the color of the bar in the middle, in an effort to make out the shape of the bar.The gradient background makes you think the bar is the opposite gradient in order to clearly see the shape of the bar

#### Color and brightness constancies

Perceptual constancies are sources of illusions. Color constancy and brightness constancy are responsible for the fact that a familiar object will appear the same color regardless of the amount of light or color of light reflecting from it. An illusion of color difference or luminosity difference can be created when the luminosity or color of the area surrounding an unfamiliar object is changed. The luminosity of the object will appear brighter against a black field (that reflects less light) compared to a white field, even though the object itself did not change in luminosity. Similarly, the eye will compensate for color contrast depending on the color cast of the surrounding area.

In addition to the gestalt principles of perception, water-color illusions contribute to the formation of optical illusions. Water-color illusions consist of object-hole effects and coloration. Object-hole effects occur when boundaries are prominent where there is a figure and background with a hole that is 3D volumetric in appearance. Coloration consists of an assimilation of color radiating from a thin-colored edge lining a darker chromatic contour. The water-color illusion describes how the human mind perceives the wholeness of an object such as top-down processing. Thus, contextual factors play into perceiving the brightness of an objec
 
 #### Akiyoshi Kitaoka 
One example of it was created by a Japanese psychologist, Akiyoshi Kitaoka  on a video in internet. He is a psychology professor at Ritsumeikan University in Japan, He shared a video of a piece of paper with a black-to-white gradient on it.

However, the swatches are all the same color. There's also a simple scientific explanation for why the swatch appears to change colors as Kitaoka slides it across the gradient background. 

The effect is a result of lightness perception, or the concept that our eyes perceive colors differently based on the shade of whatever object is in the background or foreground. Put simply, if there is a bright background, objects in the foreground will appear darker.

Likewise, if the background is dark, objects in the foreground will appear lighter. Other factors, such as the amount of light reflected by a surface, the orientation of the surface and whether or not it's 3D can produce similar affects. 

#### Technical  Explanation

But if you're curious for a more technical explanation, here are scientists Maria Pereverzeva and Scott O. Murray on the matter:

> _Accurate perception of surface reflectance poses a significant computational problem for the visual system. The amount of light reflected by a surface is affected by a combination of factors including the surface's reflectance properties and illumination conditions. The latter are not limited by the strength of illuminant but also include the relative placement of the light illuminating the surface, the orientation of the surface and its 3d shape, all of which result in a pattern of luminance gradients across the surface_

#### Example of illusion

By clicked the picture the gradient disappear and you can appreciate the white color of the brick.
