# Photomosaic
It is a technique that a set of images to recreate a picture. The picture is partinioned in sections of equal sized. Each section or tile is changed by a image that matches with the color or brightness the tile has. 
### Problem Statement
Recreate  input picture based on a set of overlapping images.
### Background
Fascination with mosaics is not a new thing. Mosaic is an art that has been around for a long time. A picture is being generated using small, colourful stones or glass pieces. That is how famous artworks in palaces and villas were created. Today's view of mosaics is still very much effected by those ancient artworks.

Over the centuries this art technique was preserved and was responsible for the visual design of important architectural structures. In the time of the Renaissance and Classicism they became more important. In those times the mosaic technique and handwork were in trend. Because of that mosaics can still be seen in the remnants of those times, in ruins and buildings from those eras.

Mosaics are also related to the controversial painting style Pointillism. Pointillism reached its peak at the end of the 19th Century. Today it is present in the works of Paul Signac, Henri Edmond Delacroix or Georges Seurat.

The modern photo mosaic is based on the same idea: a large image made from many small, colorful pieces. With one difference- the „mosaic stones“, the photos, each have their own image as well. This way there are two dimensions to the image. The main image, which gives the mosaic its overall effect, and the many individual images. A photo is formed by photos.
### Methodology
A mosaic is created by joining together a number of overlapping images and converting them into a single, seamless picture. Including a photographic scale in the mosaic then allow to take measurements from it or to convert the photograph into a scale drawing.
