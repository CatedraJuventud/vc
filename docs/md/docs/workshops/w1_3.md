# ASCII ART

*ASCII art* is a graphic design technique that uses computer characters for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from some printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard. 

## Problem statement
Create an image composed solely of ASCII characters that looks like the original image. 

## Background
Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the creations by computer-art pioneer Kenneth Knowlton from around 1966, who was working for Bell Labs at the time. "Studies in Perception I" by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art.

Computer Nude (Studies in Perception I) is the most widely circulated early artwork made using a computer. It demonstrates the unique capacity of the viewer's brain to interpret a composition of abstract symbols grouped to emulate areas of tonal value as a human figure. Leon Harmon, a researcher in cognitive neuroscience, and Ken Knowlton, a computer engineer at AT&T’s Bell Labs, reenvisioned a photograph of dancer Deborah Hay as a bitmap mosaic using a program they developed. 

ASCII art was invented very early on because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Other common uses were marking divisions between different print jobs from different users, and large banners. 

## Methodology
One of the (first) things to do when developing software is to devise which are the steps the program should take in order to achieve the desired outcome. To make ASCII art, each pixel or region of pixels from the original image must be mapped to a certain character. First, the image is converted to grayscale and then the program chooses a pixel that has a similar grayness. For example, a very dark pixel can be mapped to the character '#' or '$' which are dark, whereas a white pixel can become a dot '.' or a blanck space ' '. 


It is better to use a method that preserves the luminance of the original image in the grayscale image. This is the purpose of the [luma weighted sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Lightness) where each pixel’s intensity or grey value is simply the weighted sum of the values of its RGB components computed as follows: 

> :Formula align=center
>
> ```
> Y_{706} = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B \\
> ```

Another good thing to do before applying luma is increasing the contrast of the image. That way the color range of the image increases and more characters get selected. This creates a nicer and sharper image. 

In short, the image passed trough a high contrast filter, then the luma weighted sum is applyed and finally the image gets mapped pixel by pixel to a character of similar brightness.

## Code
This program is written in ```javascrip``` and uses a very powerfull drawing library called [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

### Contrast Adjustment
The contrast of an image is the difference between the maximum and minimum pixel intensity, the “amount” of separation between its darkest and brightest areas. It is then determined by the colour and brightness of the different objects or shapes that appear in the image. This means that the higher the contrast, the bigger the difference between pixel intensities, and the easier it will be to recognize the different objects in the image (due to this bigger range of intensities). The code was based on [Cassie's implementation](https://editor.p5js.org/cassie/sketches/SB4pBjns0).

```javascript
/**
 * Function based on https://editor.p5js.org/cassie/sketches/SB4pBjns0
 * 
 * @param {*} img image to be processed. Function changes the same reference to image 
 * @param {*} contrast 0 to 100
 */
function applyContrast(img, contrast) {
  img.loadPixels();
  for (let x = 0; x < img.width; x +=1) {
    for (let y = 0; y < img.height; y +=1) {
      let c = img.get(x,y);
      let factor = (259 * (contrast + 255)) / (255 * (259 - contrast));
      let nR = constrain(factor*(red(c)-128) + 128, 0, 255);
      let nG = constrain(factor*(green(c)-128) + 128, 0, 255);
      let nB = constrain(factor*(blue(c)-128) + 128, 0, 255);
      let nC = color(nR,nG,nB);
      img.set(x,y,nC);
    }
  }
  img.updatePixels();
}
```

### Grayscale conversion

The function takes an image and applies the ```luma_Y``` inline function to every pixel of the image. After that, it returns the luma brightness index per pixel. The funtion also returns the maximum (white pixel) and minimum (black pixel) possible values of brightness. These values are going to be used in the next step to map grayscale values to ASCII characters.

```javascript
/**
 * Applies luma to every pixel of given image
 * @param {*} img : image to be processed. Function changes the same reference to image 
 * @returns 
 */
function applyLuma (img){
  let lumaMatrix = []; // Stores luma values in matrix : [[row1], [row2], ..., [rowN]]

  let luma_Y = (pixel) => 0.2126 * red(pixel) + 0.7152 * green(pixel) + 0.0722 * blue(pixel);
  img.loadPixels();
  for (let j = 0; j < img.height; j++) {
    let row = [] // Single row of the matrix
    for (let i = 0; i < img.width; i++) {
      row.push(luma_Y(img.get(i, j))); // Apply luma to every pixel in image
    }
    lumaMatrix.push(row); 
  }
  return { 
    values: lumaMatrix ,
    minValue: luma_Y(color(0, 0, 0)), // Used for mapPixelToASCII
    maxValue: luma_Y(color(255, 255, 255)) // Used in mapPixelToASCII
  }
}
```

After these two steps we get a proper grayscale image. In the next canvas (created in p5.js) you can see the result of these two steps. The image on the left is the original, the center image is after the contrast filter, and the one on the right is the final image after [luma weighted sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#Lightness) applyed.

### Pixel to character mapping

As previously said, each character must be given a certain brightness index. This index must be high for characters like ```'#'``` or ```'@'``` and should be low for a dot ```'.'``` or a space ```' '```. This can be challenging as ASCII characters have no intrinsic grayness, because this only depends on how they are drawn on your screen - in what font, size, and horizontal and vertical spacing, and in what colors. [This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30097953/ascii-art-sorting-an-array-of-ascii-characters-by-brightness-levels-c-c) describes some ways to solve this problem, such as counting every colored pixel and selecting a monospace font.

This programs uses the list given by [Paul Bourke in Character representation of grey scale images](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/asciiart/). The "Standard" character ramp for grey scale pictures, black -> white.

> "$@B%8&WM#*oahkbdpqwmZO0QLCJUYXzcvunxrjft/\|()1{}[]?-_+~<>i!lI;:,"^`'. "

The code to transform the image is very easy. The program passes trough every grayscale value and [maps](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map) the position of a character in the list. Please note how the maximum and minimum are used. 

```javascript
/**
 * Maps value of every pixel to an ascii character
 * @param {*} imgProcessOutput Dictionary of processed image. Must have keywords .values .maxValue and .minValue
 * @returns Char[][] Matrix of characters
 */
function mapPixelToASCII(imgProcessOutput) {
  // ASCII order taken from http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/asciiart/
  let characters = "$@B%8&WM#*oahkbdpqwmZO0QLCJUYXzcvunxrjft/\|()1{}[]?-_+~<>i!lI;:,\"^`'. ";

  let minValue = imgProcessOutput.minValue;
  let maxValue = imgProcessOutput.maxValue;
  return imgProcessOutput.values.map((row) => {
    return row.map((value) => {
      let position = Math.round(map(value, minValue, maxValue, 0, characters.length - 1));
      return characters[position];
    })
  })
}
```

### All put together
```javascript
let img_original;

function preload() {
  let location = '../sketches/workshop1/w3/lenna.png';
  img_original = loadImage(location);
}

function setup() {
  createCanvas(700, 800);
  img_original.resize(150, 150);

  imgProcessOutput = imagePreprocessing(img_original, contrast=100); // applies contrast and luma to image. Changes img_transformed by reference
  let ascii_image = mapPixelToASCII(imgProcessOutput); // takes every luma value and assings an ascci character according to brighness
  printCharacters(ascii_image, 5, 0, size=5); // Prints all characters every 'size' px apart  
}

function imagePreprocessing (img, contrast){
  applyContrast(img, contrast);
  return applyLuma(img);
}

function applyLuma (img){
  let lumaMatrix = []; // Stores luma values in matrix : [[row1], [row2], ..., [rowN]]

  let luma_Y = (pixel) => 0.2126 * red(pixel) + 0.7152 * green(pixel) + 0.0722 * blue(pixel);
  img.loadPixels();
  for (let j = 0; j < img.height; j++) {
    let row = [] // Single row of the matrix
    for (let i = 0; i < img.width; i++) {
      row.push(luma_Y(img.get(i, j))); // Apply luma to every pixel in image
    }
    lumaMatrix.push(row); 
  }
  return { 
    values: lumaMatrix ,
    minValue: luma_Y(color(0, 0, 0)), // Used for mapPixelToASCII
    maxValue: luma_Y(color(255, 255, 255)) // Used in mapPixelToASCII
  }
}

function applyContrast(img, contrast) {
  img.loadPixels();
  for (let x = 0; x < img.width; x +=1) {
    for (let y = 0; y < img.height; y +=1) {
      let c = img.get(x,y);
      let factor = (259 * (contrast + 255)) / (255 * (259 - contrast));
      let nR = constrain(factor*(red(c)-128) + 128, 0, 255);
      let nG = constrain(factor*(green(c)-128) + 128, 0, 255);
      let nB = constrain(factor*(blue(c)-128) + 128, 0, 255);
      let nC = color(nR,nG,nB);
      img.set(x,y,nC);
    }
  }
  img.updatePixels();
}

function printCharacters(ascii_image, x_start, y_start, size) {
  let h = ascii_image.length;
  let w = ascii_image[0].length;
  textFont('Courier New');
  textSize(size);
  for (let i = 0; i < h; i++){
    for (let j = 0; j < w; j++){
      let x = x_start + size * j;
      let y = y_start + size * i;
      text(ascii_image[i][j], x, y)
    }
  }
}

function mapPixelToASCII(imgProcessOutput) {
  // ASCII order taken from http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/asciiart/
  let characters = "$@B%8&WM#*oahkbdpqwmZO0QLCJUYXzcvunxrjft/\|()1{}[]?-_+~<>i!lI;:,\"^`'. ";

  let minValue = imgProcessOutput.minValue;
  let maxValue = imgProcessOutput.maxValue;
  return imgProcessOutput.values.map((row) => {
    return row.map((value) => {
      let position = Math.round(map(value, minValue, maxValue, 0, characters.length - 1));
      return characters[position];
    })
  })
}

```

## Conclusions & future work
 - It is necessary to preprocess the image before grayscaling to maximize the quality of ASCII image.  
 - The bigger the image size, the better ASCII output image quality.  
 - High contrast images throw better results, as the ASCII characters are more varied.  
 - Human perception plays a major role on identifying different objects inside the ASCII image. 

There are many improvements that could be done to make the program more efficient and more functionalities could be implemented. However, what has been explained here should be enough to get someone started.
