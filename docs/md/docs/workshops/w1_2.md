# Convolutional Mask
## Problem Statement
Apply some convolution mask to images and video
## Background
convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) that produces a third function (f*g) that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. in the case of image processing the convolution is the proccess of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors , weighted by the kernel to extract certain features from an input image.The kernels will define the size of the convolution, the weights applied to it, and an anchor point usually positioned at the center.The origin is the position of the kernel which is above (conceptually) the current output pixel. For a symmetric kernel, the origin is usually the center element.

Of course we are not restricted to 3x3 kernels - this was only done for simplicity. Kernels can be of just about any size. More sophisticated kernels are typically larger, in fact many image processing software packages have options to customize a kernel.

One of the earliest uses of the convolution integral appeared in D'Alembert's derivation of Taylor's theorem in Recherches sur différents points importants du système du monde, published in 1754. Soon thereafter, convolution operations appear in the works of Pierre Simon Laplace, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, Siméon Denis Poisson, and others. The term itself did not come into wide use until the 1950s or 60s. 

## Code and Results
### Image

#### Convolution function

First to apply a kernel to a part of an image we use the convolution funtion. This function return the result color of the convolution. 
> This function is generic, it is useful for any kernel

```js | convolution()

function convolution(x, y, matrix, matrixsize, img) {
    let rtotal = 0.0;
    let gtotal = 0.0;
    let btotal = 0.0;
    const offset = Math.floor(matrixsize / 2);
    for (let i = 0; i < matrixsize; i++){
      for (let j = 0; j < matrixsize; j++){
        
        // What pixel are we testing
        const xloc = (x + i - offset);
        const yloc = (y + j - offset);
        let loc = (xloc + img.width * yloc) * 4;
  
        // Make sure we haven't walked off our image, we could do better here
        loc = constrain(loc, 0 , img.pixels.length - 1);
  
        // Calculate the convolution
        // retrieve RGB values
        rtotal += (img.pixels[loc]) * matrix[i][j];
        gtotal += (img.pixels[loc + 1]) * matrix[i][j];
        btotal += (img.pixels[loc + 2]) * matrix[i][j];
      }
    }
    // Make sure RGB is within range
    rtotal = constrain(rtotal, 0, 255);
    gtotal = constrain(gtotal, 0, 255);
    btotal = constrain(btotal, 0, 255);
    
    // Return the resulting color
    return color(rtotal, gtotal, btotal);
  } 
```

Then to apply the kernel to the whole image we use the function conv(). This function apply an draw the kernel in a new image.

> This function is generic, it is useful for any kernel of size 3*3

``` js | conv()
function conv(edgeImg,kernel, posX, posY){
    edgeImg.loadPixels()

    for (let x = 0; x <img.width; x++) {
        for (let y = 0; y < img.height; y++ ) {
        let c = convolution(x, y, kernel, 3, img);
        let loc = (x + y*img.width) * 4;
        edgeImg.pixels[loc] = red(c);
        edgeImg.pixels[loc + 1] = green(c);
        edgeImg.pixels[loc + 2] = blue(c);
        edgeImg.pixels[loc + 3] = alpha(c);
        
        }
    }

    edgeImg.updatePixels();
    
    image(edgeImg, posX, posY, c_w/2, c_h/2);
}
```

#### Result


#### Original image
We're going to use the Lenna photos to apply our Kernel.

#### Sharpen

Sharpening an image increases the contrast between bright and dark regions to bring out features. We use the following kernel

``` js | Sharpe.js
 kernel = [  [ 0, -1, 0 ],
          [ -1,  5, -1],
          [ 0, -1, 0 ] ]; 
let img;
let w = 80;
let c_w = 700;
let c_h = 700;

function preload() {
    img = loadImage('../sketches/lenna.png');
    
}
 
function setup() {
    createCanvas(c_w, c_h);
    noLoop();
}


function draw() {   

    img.loadPixels()

    SharpenImg = createImage(img.width, img.height); 
    conv (SharpenImg, kernel, 0, 0)
  
}
```
Finally we obtein de next image

#### Emboss

Image embossing is a computer graphics technique in which each pixel of an image is replaced either by a highlight or a shadow, depending on light/dark boundaries on the original image. Low contrast areas are replaced by a gray background. The filtered image will represent the rate of color change at each location of the original image. Applying an embossing filter to an image often results in an image resembling a paper or metal embossing of the original image, hence the name. 

We use the next Kernel

``` js | Emboss.js
 kernel = [ [ 1,  1,  0],
            [ 1,  0, -1 ],
            [ 0,  -1,  -1] ]
let img;
let w = 80;
let c_w = 700;
let c_h = 700;

function preload() {
    img = loadImage('../sketches/lenna.png');
    
}
 
function setup() {
    createCanvas(c_w, c_h);
    noLoop();
}


function draw() {   

    img.loadPixels()
    EmbossImg = createImage(img.width, img.height); 
    conv (EmbossImg , kernel, c_w/2, 0)
  
}
```
Finally we obtein de next image

#### Edge detection

Edge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying points in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities. The points at which image brightness changes sharply are typically organized into a set of curved line segments termed edges. The same problem of finding discontinuities in one-dimensional signals is known as step detection and the problem of finding signal discontinuities over time is known as change detection. Edge detection is a fundamental tool in image processing, machine vision and computer vision, particularly in the areas of feature detection and feature extraction.[

We use the next Kernel

``` js | edgeDetection.js
 kernel = 1/9 *[[ -1, -1, -1 ],
                [ -1,  8, -1 ],
                [ -1, -1, -1 ] ]
let img;
let w = 80;
let c_w = 700;
let c_h = 700;

function preload() {
    img = loadImage('../sketches/lenna.png');
    
}
 
function setup() {
    createCanvas(c_w, c_h);
    noLoop();
}


function draw() {   

    img.loadPixels()
    edgeImg = createImage(img.width, img.height); 
    conv (edgeImg, kernel, 0, c_h/2)
}          
```
Finally we obtein de next image
> :P5 sketch=/docs/sketches/workshop1/w2/edgeDetection.js, width=500, height=500

#### Box Blur

A box blur (also known as a box linear filter) is a spatial domain linear filter in which each pixel in the resulting image has a value equal to the average value of its neighboring pixels in the input image. It is a form of low-pass ("blurring") filter. A 3 by 3 box blur ("radius 1") can be written as matrix

We use the next Kernel

``` js | Box_blur.js
 kernel = 1/9 *[[ 1, 1, 1 ],
                [ 1, 1, 1 ],
                [ 1, 1, 1 ] ]

 Kernel = [ [0.11, 0.11, 0.11],
            [0.11, 0.11, 0.11],
            [0.11, 0.11, 0.11] ]
let img;
let w = 80;
let c_w = 700;
let c_h = 700;

function preload() {
    img = loadImage('../sketches/lenna.png');
    
}
 
function setup() {
    createCanvas(c_w, c_h);
    noLoop();
}


function draw() {   

    img.loadPixels()
    BlurImg = createImage(img.width, img.height); 
    conv (BlurImg , kernel, c_w/2, c_h/2)
}
```
Finally we obtein de next image

### Video
For video we can get pixels periodically from de canvas and make the convolution with the kernels, in this case we only show three frames by second. Hence we paint a new image with the result of the convolution under the original video. Click on the canvas for play the video and next on the button for change the kernel and see the new convolution:

      let c = convolution(x, y, matrix, matrixsize, fingers);
      let loc = (x + y*fingers.width) * 4;
      lienzo.pixels[loc] = red(c);
      lienzo.pixels[loc + 1] = green(c);
      lienzo.pixels[loc + 2] = blue(c);
      lienzo.pixels[loc + 3] = alpha(c);
    }
  }
  lienzo.updatePixels();
  image(fingers,0,0); 
  image(lienzo,fingers.width+1,0);
}
function changeMatrix(){

  matrix=matrixCarrousel[contador];
}

function pauseVideo() {
  reproduce = !reproduce;
  if (reproduce){
    
    loop();
    fingers.loop(); // al presionar en el lienzo blanco inicia el video
  }else{

    fingers.pause(); // al presionar en el lienzo blanco inicia el video
  }
}

```
## Conclusions and Future Work
- Convolution allows us to extract certain features from images based on locally analysis of pixels and its weighted sum.
- The kernels will define the size of the convolution.
- Depending on the element values, a kernel can cause a wide range of effects.
- The values of a given pixel in the output image are calculated by multiplying each kernel value by the corresponding input image pixel values

For future work we can highlight convolutional neural networks that apply multiple cascaded convolution kernels with applications in machine vision and artificial intelligence. Though these are actually cross correlations rather than convolutions. And also in analytical chemistry, Savitzky–Golay smoothing filters are used for the analysis of spectroscopic data. They can improve signal-to-noise ratio with minimal distortion of the spectra
